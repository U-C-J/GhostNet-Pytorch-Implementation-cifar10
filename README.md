# GhostNet-Pytorch-Implementation-cifar10


I would like to modify ResNet with Ghost Module. The implementation was inclueded in testmodel\resnet.py.

I tested the model complexity of ResNet56 and ResNet56-ghost. The result is as below:

ResNet56:
Computational complexity:       126.55 MMac
Number of parameters:           0.85 M  

ResNet56-ghost:
Computational complexity:       66.61 MMac
Number of parameters:           0.44 M
